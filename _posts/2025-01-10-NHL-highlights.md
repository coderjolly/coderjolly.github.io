## 1. Data Acquisition and Visualisation
**NOTE** : A more detailed version of this section is documented in the this [link]({{ site.url }}/articles/24/NHL-milestone1).

### 1.1 Data Acquisition
In this section, we first download the play-by-play events for each game using the publicly available NHL API:

[https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/{GAME_ID}/play-by-play](https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/{GAME_ID}/play-by-play)

To fetch the play-by-play events of a game of your choice, it is recommended to follow the following format:

Figuring out Game IDs for each season:

Since we download play-by-play events from each game (Regular and Playoffs) from seasons 2016-2017 to 2023-2024, we break-down the logic behind the naming of GAME_ID as mentioned in the following link :

[NHL API Game IDs Documentation](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md#game-ids)

In brief, suppose we take GAME_ID ``` 2019020901 ``` and GAME_ID ``` 2021030217 ``` , the breakdown from left to right would be as follows:

``` 2019020901 ```
- '2019' for the season 2019-2020.
- '02' for regular season.
- '0901' for game number 901 in the regular season.

``` 2021030217 ```
- '2021' for the season 2021-2022.
- '03' for the playoff season.
- '0217' -> For playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game (out of 7). (In this example: 7th game of match #1 in playoff round 2.)

In our project, we ping each game and cache the play-by-play events for ALL NHL games from seasons 2016-2017 to 2023-2024 (including regular and playoffs games!). For more explanations, we have a [detailed webpage]({{ site.url }}/articles/24/NHL-milestone1){:target="_blank"} dedicated to this section.

### 1.2 Simple Visualizations

All the following plots were obtained using the cumulative play-by-play data from all seasons and games mentioned in the previous section.

### Shot types

**NOTE** for detailed explanations for this section follow this [link]({{ site.url }}/articles/24/NHL-milestone1).

Important note: for this analysis, we have decided to drop shot types that have been used less than 0.1%, because they don't represent meaningful information, especially when compared to other shot types.
The shot types dropped were "between-legs" and "cradle", with 0.06% and 0.005% usage, respectively.

### 1.3 Advanced Visualisations


For the advanced visualisations, we have decided to include missed shots in our calculations to get a more complete picture of offensive performance.

## 2. Feature Engineering and Model Training

### 2.1 Histogram of shot counts binned by shot distance and shot angle

**NOTE**: The 'Non-Goals' are shots classified as 'shot-on-goal' and 'missed-shots' in our data for seasons from 2016-2017 upto 2019-2020(4 seasons). Additionally, shot angles are higher for shots that are taken head-on. For example, a shot angle of 90 degrees means it is directed along the same line as taking a shot from the centre of the pitch towards goal.

## 3 Application Demo using live NHL game
The video starts by starting both containers with the `docker-compose up` command.  
Then, the client app is demonstrated into the browser. The user can select a model and the game ID. The game ID selected was actually live during the recording of the video ([January 13th, 2025, Calgary Flames vs. Chicago Blackhawks](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/cgy-vs-chi/2025/01/13/2024020690/boxscore)).  
We can see that the first select model predicts "0.4" goals for the Flames, and "0.6" goals for the Blackhawks, while the score was 1-1 when recording the video (there was 13 minutes left in the first period).
